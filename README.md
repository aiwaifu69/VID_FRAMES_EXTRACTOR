- pip install tkinter
3.  concurrent.futures

This also comes pre-installed with Python. No separate installation needed.
So in summary, you just need to install OpenCV using pip.

The steps would be:

Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
Open Command Prompt/Terminal
Run:
<!---->

- pip install opencv-python
4.  Once OpenCV is installed successfully, you can run the Python script:
